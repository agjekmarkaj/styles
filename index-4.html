			<p><figcaption><strong>Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy:</strong> If you want, over several hundred pages, 
			to see a fine young working-class man try painfully hard to better himself and fail abjectly;
			get<br />repeatedly duped, tricked, manipulated, knocked back and deserted by all comers, from Christminster
			(for which, read "Oxford") university, to his supposed nearest and dearest -<br />and finally die 
			in penury, abandoned by his true love, and un-mourned by his grasping belle - then yes, by all means
			tuck into Hardy's last novel. What could be more fun.</figcaption></p>
